Data Science enthusiast trying to deep dive in the field of Data Analytics/Data Science. I have completed my Post Graduate Program in Data Science from Praxis Business School, Bangalore. Previously I worked with Capgemini as an Associate Consultant for almost 3 years.

I started this blog with a sole purpose to supplement my own understanding about the new concepts that I learn and also help others learn about them. I also write for publications on Medium like Analytics Vidhya.
